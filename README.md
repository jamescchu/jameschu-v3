# James v3

Personal portfolio site for James Chu.

### Tech

The site uses a number of open source projects to function properly:

* [Hexo] - Node.js powered static site generator
* [Gulp] - streaming build system
* [NodeJS] - event driven I/O runtime
* [SASS] - feature extension for CSS
* [Pug] - HTML template engine
* [Bower] - web package manager
* [Sanitize CSS] - best practice browser CSS normalization
* [Barba] - pushState and AJAX API
