This is student project to envision and total redesign and rebrand of Major League Gaming (MLG).

### Research

In order to create a new brand that is unique to MLG, I conducted a complete audit of the brand as it stands today.

Firstly, it is paramount that MLG's mission statement is preserved in order to guide this rebrand. Thus it is extracted as-is from their existing website.

>MLGâ€™s mission is to promote eSports globally through premier competition and to deliver premium gaming content to viewers anytime, anywhere through our global streaming platform - MLG.tv

There is a clear lack of consistency in the overall brand and design, color fragmentation on the web is especially severe.

### Competitor Landscape

Since it seems that Major League Gaming needs to hold up on two different fronts, I needed to analyze the competitor landscape separately.

### Brand Direction

With all the information gathered, I can now come up with a revised direction that I feel would best fit MLG's current and future agenda's.
